# crypto-tools
my personal collection of tools used for gathering various data on cryptocurrency; potentially useful for making more informed trades and investments. 

- twitter: counts mentions of different cryptocoins on Twitter and signals if number of mentions jumps an unusual amount. can be streamed using Spark with Scala and the Twitter API. 

- volume (IN PROGRESS): periodically checks cryptocoin volume and fires signals when volume jumps an unusual amount. can be ran using Python with Bittrex API.
